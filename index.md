  * We are using [GitHub's education service](https://education.github.com/) to host student repos for WebDev courses.

## UO CIT Minor
  * The computer science department offers a Computer and Information Technology (CIT) minor, which emphasizes open-source technology and computing skills such as web development, networks, database programming and cloud computing. [Read more about the CIT minor at cs.uoregon.edu](https://cs.uoregon.edu/undergraduate/cit-minor).

## What the CIT Minor is About
  * From logical thought to programming, database concepts to website architecture, information privacy and security to networking and multimedia, the CIT minor is designed to help you understand how Information and Web technologies can be used to transform information in your own field of study.

  * The CIT minor uses open-source web technologies, networks, databases and cloud-computing to create, store, transmit and publish content on the world wide web, and cloud servers.

  * In the first year of the minor students learn IT concepts (such as networks, databases, and the WWW), and become skilled in using both basic and advanced web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, React, etc.).

  * In the second year of the minor, students study the following topics: database design, WebDev frameworks, computer networks & cyber-security.

## My University of Oregon CIS/CIT Experience
  *  So far, as of June 2018, the I.T. courses I've taken at the UO are **CIS 110** which focused on _HTML_ and _CSS_, **CIS 111** which focused on _JavaScript_, and now **CIT 281** which focused on _Web Application Development_.

### My CIS 110 Experience (Spring 2017)
  * My roots in CIS and related fields, this is where I created my first website using only HTML and CSS. It's not my most proud work, but it was a good start, by the end of the year. This is also where I learned basic IT concepts!

### My CIS 111 Experience (Fall 2017)
  * Following CIS 110, I started learning about command-line JavaScript here. I wasn't the best at it, and struggled to complete things myself (I was always just one step away!). This was a necessary class, though, and I'm glad I took it, even if I took it during a time when ES5 was the current ES version.

### My CIT 281 Experience (Spring 2018)
  * Most recently, I've had the pleasure of experiencing Web Application Development. For somebody like me who is less interested in the creation of programs, software, etc. and more in the easier parts of coding, this has been a perfect step into the deeper material and new understandings of ES6! Things I've learned in CIT 281:
    - Unix Shell
    - Git & GitHub
    - jQuery
    - AJAX (fetch and promises)
    - Node and express
    - ES6 Classes & Super
    - React
    - GitHub Pages
